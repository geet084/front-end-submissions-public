# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[Travis happy code](https://github.com/ericweissman/fe-palette-picker/blob/f2a792b70869c240c23c96595adb440553af04bd/src/thunks/handleProject.js#L1)

* Travis - I'm proud of this because it really dried up our code and it was pretty challenging condensing the 8 thunks we had down to 2

[Eric happy code](https://github.com/ericweissman/fe-palette-picker/blob/f2a792b70869c240c23c96595adb440553af04bd/src/containers/Generator/Generator.js#L23)

* Eric - I'm proud that we were able to generate the colors based on a string and that I was able to figure out how to lock the colors, it was really rewarding when I figured that out

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about

[Eric sad code](https://github.com/ericweissman/fe-palette-picker/blob/f2a792b70869c240c23c96595adb440553af04bd/src/reducers/palettesReducer.js#L9)

* Eric - This felt more redundant, like we had to type too much out for it to work. Given more time I think that we could have cleaned it up quite a bit

[Travis sad code](https://github.com/ericweissman/fe-palette-picker/blob/f2a792b70869c240c23c96595adb440553af04bd/src/containers/ProjectCard/ProjectCard.js#L1)

* Travis - I'm not thrilled about this because it feels like there is too much going on in the one component and it could be more than one / we ran out of time for the deadline.



#### Link to Design Inspiration
# to do
* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

#### Reflection on New Concepts

* Describe your thoughts on server-side testing
  * We both liked the progress we made on the server testing and that we were able to incorporate TDD into it. We were able to get to 90% coverage (missing 500 errors currently) and it felt great to be able to also test more than just status codes.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI
  * It demistifies things quite a bit and we understand why you would use it on a larger production database/project. While it is a pain to setup, it simplifies things later.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
  * It was good to do another rep with it after having already done it in Trapper Keeper.
